# Installation & Setup
To get started, download the latest version of auto-mcs [from the website](https://www.auto-mcs.com/download), or [from GitHub](https://github.com/macarooni-man/auto-mcs/releases/latest). Extract auto-mcs from the `.zip` file to a location of your choice and launch it. That's it, there's no installation required!
> Note:  If you're using Linux, you might need to run `chmod +x auto-mcs` to give the binary executable permission

<br>
To start, you can either import a server you've made on your own or create a new one from scratch:

### Create a New Server
- For the vast majority of users, auto-mcs is preconfigured to provide optimal settings. Choose a name, and click next a few times to get started!
- For a more advanced setup you can choose a different distribution with mods, an older version, or even choose to set up a whitelist. There are a lot of options if you wish to configure it manually.

### Import a Server
- auto-mcs can detect and manage a wide variety of servers that you have made yourself. Select the root folder of the server and click import to use all of auto-mcs's features!
> Note: Importing will copy your server to a different directory and create a backup. The original directory will be untouched

<br>
And that's it - click launch to play with your friends!

<br><br>
